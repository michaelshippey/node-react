# node-react
This is a simple application that uses hello world from react and node js. 
Before starting the application you must use the following steps from the root directory.
# 1. npm install --save express body-parser mongoose
# 2. npm install --save-dev nodemon concurrently
Nodemon is a package that allows you to run node.js application and listen to any file changes, updating the entire appp
Concurrently lets us run multiple npm commands at the same time.
# 3. cd client
# 4. yarn add axios
run this command in the client directory 
axios is a popular promise based http client for browser and node.js and its what we will need to be using later on.
# 5. cd ..
# 6. npm run dev
use this command to spin up the development environment for both react and node
